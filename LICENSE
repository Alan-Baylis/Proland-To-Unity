Proland is a RESEARCH PROTOTYPE, not a commercial software library. Its main
purpose is to foster research on real-time and realistic rendering algorithms.
It provides a framework and several predefined algorithms allowing researchers
to develop new ideas, without having to redevelop a full rendering engine to
show their results. In return, the new algorithms developed with Proland must
be licensed with the GPL (dual licensing with a commercial license is possible
too, see http://proland.inrialpes.fr/contact.html).
